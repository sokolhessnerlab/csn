## Participants we are excluding from analysis

### How many participants are excluded from the analysis phase?

A total of **3 participants** of 49 eligible (completed task) are being
fully excluded from analysis.

### Which participants are excluded and why?

The following participants are excluded:

  - CSN002
  - CSN011
  - CSN027

These three participants are excluded due to poor eye-tracker
calibration quality, as determined by the validation metric `avg_error`
at pre- and post-task validation phases. A participantâ€™s eye-tracking
quality is *good enough* for analysis if the average error is less than
2.5 degrees at *both* validation and re-validation phases.
