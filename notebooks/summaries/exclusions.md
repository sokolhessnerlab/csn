## Participants we are excludinbg from analysis

### How many participants are excluded from the analysis phase?

A total of **2 participants** of 49 eligible (completed task) are being
fully excluded from analysis.

### Which participants are excluded and why?

Both CSN011 and CSN027 are excluded from the analysis due to poor
calibration of eye-tracking quality, as determined by the change in
validation metric `avg_error` between pre- and post-task validation
phases. Our upper bound of average error that is *good enough* to be
considered for analysis is 2.5 degrees. For a participant to be
included, the average error must be within 2.5 degress at *both*
validation and re-validation.
