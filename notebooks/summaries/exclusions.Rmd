## Participants we are excludinbg from analysis

### How many participants are excluded from the analysis phase?

A total of **2 participants** of 49 eligible (completed task) are being fully excluded from analysis.

### Which participants are excluded and why?

Both CSN011 and CSN027 are excluded from the analysis due to poor calibration
of eye-tracking quality, as determined by the change in validation metric `avg_error`
between pre- and post-task validation phases. Our upper bound of average error that 
is _good enough_ to be considered for analysis is 2.5 degrees. For a participant to
be included, the average error must be within 2.5 degress at _both_ validation and
re-validation.
