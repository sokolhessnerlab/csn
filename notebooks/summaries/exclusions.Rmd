## Participants we are excluding from analysis

### How many participants are excluded from the analysis phase?

A total of **3 participants** of 49 eligible (completed task) are being fully excluded from analysis.

### Which participants are excluded and why?

The following participants are excluded:

- CSN002
- CSN011
- CSN027

These three participants are excluded due to poor eye-tracker calibration quality,
as determined by the validation metric `avg_error` at pre- and post-task validation phases.
A participant's eye-tracking quality is _good enough_ for analysis if the average error is
less than 2.5 degrees at _both_ validation and re-validation phases.
