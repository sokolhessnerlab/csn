## Participants who did not complete the task

### How many participants were incomplete?

A total of **7 participants** of 57 recruited did *not complete* the
task.

### What were the reasons participants did not complete the task?

The reasons participants did not complete the task are briefly described
in the following list by participant identifier:

  - CSN003 had calibration issues (wore glasses)
  - CSN014 had calibration issues (too much eye makeup)
  - CSN024 stopped early due to illness
  - CSN028 had calibration issues (difficult eye shape)
  - CSN031 had calibration issues (wore glasses)
  - CSN046 stopped early due to graphic images
  - CSN050 had calibration issues (wore contacts)

### Can we group the incompletes by common reasons?

Yes, the incompletes can be grouped by two common reasons:

1.  Calibration difficulty (i.e., corrective lenses or make-up) applies
    to 5 of 7 incompletes
2.  Deciding to stop the task early (i.e., illness or difficulty with
    image content) applies to 2 of 7 incompletes
