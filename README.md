# itrackvalr: Toolkit to analyze value by tracking eye gaze (in R)

## About this package

The `itrackvalr` package provides a collection of functions that make it easier to work with the various data sources used in value-based eye-tracking experiments.

### TODO items

Plots for each tier of thresholding, such as 1.5 degrees and 2.5 degrees. Write
summaries of how validation-revalidation participant groups look. Start a separate RMarkdown to generate per-idea summaries.

- [ ] What groups of participants are we using based on thresholds?
- [ ] How do we do dimensional reduction?
- [ ] Apply offsets to gx/gy THEN flip to consistent side for all participants

## Prerequisites

You must have R and RStudio installed on your computer.

## Setup for project team

Clone this repository into your local project folder using GitHub Desktop or via the command line using

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sokolhessnerlab/itrackvalr.git
```

Then, open the `itrackvalr` directory and double-click on `itrackvalr.Rproj` to launch the project in RStudio. When RStudio first loads the project, it will source the included `.RProfile` to configure helpful defaults for your session.
