### Summary title

A short phrase describing the summary goes here. For example, "Summary of participants who did not complete the task."

### Brief summary description

The TL;DR/abstract of the summary. A short paragraph (only a few sentences at most), in generalities, describing the contents of the rest of the summary. For example, "Out of 57 participants, 8 did not complete the task. Most incompletions were due difficulties with eye-tracker calibrations, or because participants withdrew due to the intense nature of some of the experimental stimuli."

### Specifics

All the details, for example subject numbers & reasons for exclusion; estimates and p-values; graphs of results; specific challenges encountered, and how they were dealt with; etc.

### Conclusions, next steps, and open questions (optional)
